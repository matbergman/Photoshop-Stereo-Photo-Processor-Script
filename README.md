Photoshop Stereo Photo Processor Script
=======================================

A Photoshop JavaScript stereo (3-D) photo format processor. 

Inputs a folder of parallel stereo images (a single, side-by-side, left image on the left) in .jpg format.

The Photoshop .psd that's generated organizes each format in a separate layer group. The .xml manifest logs all values selected for each photo.
